C++ Cat Chaos Game

This is the first C++ final project that I created in fall 2019 for an Intro to Computer Science class.  It was developed before I learned about refactoring (as evidenced by some very smelly code). 

In this text-based game the user is a cat (%) and must wake the dog 
(sleeping = @ awake = Q) to lure it to the next room and eventually
out of the house and out the garden gate.
