You are a tiiiiiiny little kitty, but you dream in chaos and darkness.

You are satisfied with your new human, but a filthy lazy canine also occupies 
your new lair of darkness.  The creature only eats and sleeps.  It can't even
bother to clean itself.  It is even perfectly able to thwart the humans attempt
to keep it contained and yet... it chooses not to... unless of course there is
something to eat on the other side of the gate.

I know what you're thinking... I must get rid of this bumbling beast at once!

You will have your chance!

But first...

You're going to need some advice to help you before you will be able to achieve
become a furry creature of chaotic darkness.

2. Keep moving your chaos levels will go down if you don't!
3. Time flies when you're having fun!  The seconds will go by more quickly based
on the speed of your chaos.  If you're making progress when you frantically move
